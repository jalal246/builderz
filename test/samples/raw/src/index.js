	We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck.
	In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Nice little fluffy clouds
	laying around in the sky being lazy. You have to make those little noises or
	it won't work. Clouds are free they come and go as they please.

	Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not
	every limb is perfect. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. We
	have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. The
	first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished
	in your mind before you ever start. Even trees need a friend. We all need
	friends. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your
	time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen.

	I thought today we would do a happy little picture. We don't have to be
	concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. I'm gonna
	start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue Be so
	very light. Be a gentle whisper. The only prerequisite is that it makes
	you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. This is truly an almighty
	mountain.

	That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I
	can make this world as happy as I want it. I was blessed with a very steady
	hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate
	things. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. These things happen
	automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen.

	You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you
	happy. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown,
	Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Let's make some happy
	little clouds in our world.

	Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of
	time. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Happy
	painting, God bless. You can create anything that makes you happy. Just
	make a decision and let it go. Nice little clouds playing around in the
	sky.

	Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Van Dyke
	Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. It's
	important to me that you're happy. In nature, dead trees are just as normal
	as live trees. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in
	your heart.

	There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures
	in nature. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium
	white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap
	green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. If you don't like it - change it.
	It's your world. Be brave. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than
	you do from your masterpieces.`;
